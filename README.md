# MargaDarshi - Smart route planner using graph alogithhms of Google-ortools 

A web application that displays the optimized route for a custom trip by taking location names from the user. It leverages graph optimization (TSP) using Google OR-Tools and real-world distances via OpenRouteService.

## Features
Input your starting location and up to 10 destinations

Automatically geocodes all places using OpenStreetMap

Computes travel distances using OpenRouteService (driving)

Uses Google OR-Tools to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem

 Displays optimized route on an interactive map (Folium)

 Download your map as an offline HTML file

## How it works
1. User Input  
-Starting location
-Number of destinations
-Place names for each destination
The optimized route is calculated and the map is displayed  

2. Distance Calculation  
- Uses OpenRouteService and geopy to compute accurate driving distances

3. optimisation
- Google OR-Tools TSP solver determines the most efficient visiting order

4. Output  
- An optimized route map is shown with markers and route path
- Full trip path is displayed in a readable visiting order
